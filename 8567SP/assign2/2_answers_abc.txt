a. 388 bytes
b. it moves current offset pointer to position 10L;
   and write a char of value -1;
   then rewind to the beginning of the file.
c. 10 bytes

File sizes reported in a and c differ, because in c it wrote -1 which is the value of EOF at position 10, which made the program end counting bytes at that position.
