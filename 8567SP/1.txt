There are two problems with "read(fd1, buffer, 512) > 0" in copy.c:
1.	mistakenly assigned value of "read(fd1, buffer, 512) > 0" which is a Boolean to n1, owning to that assignment is of less precedence than >.
Fix: add parenthesis around n1= read(fd1, buffer, 512) ensure n1 is assigned to the return value of read
2.	Specified read size 512 which is greater than the receiving buffer.
Fix: change 512 to the size of the receiving buffer.

By debugging, I found return value of read was always 1, meanwhile by scrutinizing the code, found buffer size was 100, but expected maximum read size was 512.
