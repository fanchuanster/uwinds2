When the last line was read, it actually has reached the end of the file but the end-of-file indiator was not set untill a next read attempt.

The last read attempt returned nothing and set the EOF indicator, in new.c it did not validate the read by checking return value neither by checking EOF of file, but wrote to the output the content of the buf, which was the content of last line by last read,
So the last line appears twice in the output.
