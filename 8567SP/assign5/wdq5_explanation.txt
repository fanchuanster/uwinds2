pcsc1.c - output is 
"User defined signal 1"
Child process sent a SIGUSR1 to parent process, whereas in parent process there is no handler registered for it yet, so it triggered the default behaviour that outputed a comment and terminate the parent process:
Signal     Value     Action   Comment
----------------------------------------------------
SIGUSR1   30,10,16    Term    User-defined signal 1

pcsc2.c - output is 
"Parent is running"
Both child process and parent process were paused without any incoming signal, switching could not happen.

pcsc3.c - output is
"Child is running
User defined signal 1"
The situation resembles what's in pcsc1.c, parent process received a SIGUSER1 from child process, however, in parent process no registered for it at that time, so it triggered default behaviour that outputed a comment and terminated the parent process.
